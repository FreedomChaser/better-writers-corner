Welcome to the Writers Corner repo!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] and also uses react, react-redux, node.js, express, massive, and postgress.

You can see my live site hosted at https://writersincorners.com.

This is the first site I've built based off of a personal idea. 

One of my favorite parts of my site is the radial menu(with radial submenus) on the home page, you can check out the codepen for it at
